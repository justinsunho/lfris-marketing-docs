# Updating Content

## Introduction

Updating content on Liferay.com is pretty easy using Liferay's built in content
management tools. However for Liferay.com, we have some special tools to make
the job even easier for our content editors.

## Live Edit

Live edit is a tool that allows you to update content directly on the page
without ever leaving the page. This works for the respective translations as
well.

To activate Live Edit:

1. Login and make sure if you have editing rights

   toolbar with some basic formatting actions. </img>
3. Make your changes
