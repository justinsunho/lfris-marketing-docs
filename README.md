## Implementation Details

### Gatsby

This site is built with [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a react-based static site generator. Please use their to [tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) to familiarize yourself.

We initialized this site with [this starter](https://github.com/diegonvs/gatsby-boilerplate), but the site evolved to better fit our use case and no longer follows most of what is provided in that starter.

Instead, we've based our architecture (atomic design) and some components on mktg-docs.liferay.com's sister site: [liferay.design](https://liferay.design/). [Repo Link](https://github.com/liferay-design/liferay.design/).

### Netlify

We use static-site host, [Netlify](http://netlify.com/). Webteam has the login credentials. We manage deployment and authentication through netlify.

### Auth

#### Logging In

All pages, except the homepage, are gated by default. Only users signed in with `@liferay.com` email addresses have access. Users can login through netlify by using the sign up tab, but it is recommended (and easier) to sign in using the `continue with google` button since `@liferay.com` emails are google accounts anyways.

Netlify Identity is unavailable locally so we have gating turned off locally (in `onCreateNode.js`)

#### Netlify Identity

We use [Netlify Identity](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/identity/) as our authentication service.

[`Auth`](https://github.com/liferay/lfris-marketing-docs/blob/master/src/components/organisms/Auth/index.js) is a wrapper component that renders content if the user is logged in or renders a login screen if they aren't. It uses `react-netlify-identity-widget` to manage user information and to generate the login modal.

#### How to Ungate/Gate a page

To ungate pages generated by Google Docs:

1. In Google Drive, select the document you wish to ungate
2. Click the 'i' icon
3. Fill the description with the following JSON Object:

```
{
  "needsAuth": false,
}
```

### Data

Since we are using Gatsby, Graphql manages our data/ is our source of data.

#### Google Docs

We built this site to provide marketers with an easy way to write documentation through Google Docs.

We use [gatsby-source-google-docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-google-docs/?=gatsby-source-google-docs) to parse and convert Google Docs' data to markdown.

#### Metadata

Users can add additional data to their files by adding a JSON object to the description field. [Documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-google-docs/#add-extra-data). None of these are required, but if users want to take the extra step, they can use these fields.

Here is an example of what to place into the description:

```
{
	"path": "/web/general/events",
	"title": "General Events",
	"description": "This is the document for general insights into how to set up events.",
	"needsAuth": false
}
```

Here is a table for the available fields and what they are:

| Field       | Description                                                              | Type                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| path        | sets the desired url path for the document                               | string ex: /test/test/              |
| title       | overrides the default title                                              | string                              |
| Date        | overrides the default date                                               | string                              |
| description | sets the description for the doc (appears in search results and indeces) | string                              |
| author      | author name                                                              | string                              |
| needsAuth   | sets if the doc will be gated                                            | boolean (don't use quotation marks) |

##### Additional Notes

Required environment variable names: `gatsby-config.js`)

Google docs Documentation: https://developers.google.com/docs/api/reference/rest

Sidenote: `gatsby-source-google-docs` sources data from google drive and google docs (hence the need for both api), transforms that into JSON, uses [json2md](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json2md) to convert the json into markdown so that the document's data can be available through `allMarkdownRemark`

#### Markdown Files

Pages can also be created by placing markdown files in the `content` folder. The metadata fields listed above can also be used in the frontmatter of your markdown files.

We currently have `gatsby-source-filesystem` turned off, so uncomment that plugin in `gatsby-config.js` to turn this markdown page generation on.

### Theme

The `/theme` is based off the `foundations` theme-contributor in lfris-www (liferay.com). Clay and bootstrap are also available.

Styles specific to components are done through [`CSS Modules`](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules).

### Search

#### Elastic Lunr Search

Elastic's lunr search [plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/@gatsby-contrib/gatsby-plugin-elasticlunr-search/) indexes our pages and makes them available for search.

[`<Search>`](https://github.com/liferay/lfris-marketing-docs/tree/master/src/components/molecules/Search) manages all things related to search. It has two views, one for use in the navigation and on for use on https://mktg-docs.liferay.com/search.

`<SearchForm>` is for user input and `<SearchResults>` displays the results. `index.js` manages the state for both.

We should re-factor to use [algolia docSearch](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/) at some point.

### Misc plugins and packages

[`gatsby-image`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image/) and [`gatsby-plugin-sharp`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-sharp/?=gatsby-plugin-sharp) Serve dynamic media.

[`gatsby-plugin-layout`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-layout/) Gatsby v1 layout functionality. This allows for page transitions.

[`gatsby-plugin-zopfli`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-zopfli/?=zopfli) Google compression plugin that serves gzip versions of assets

[`gatsby-remark-default-html-attrs`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-default-html-attrs/?=gatsby-remark-default-h) Adds classes to markdown tags

[`gatsby-source-filesystem`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem/?=gatsby-source-filesystem) Not currently in use

[`gatsby-source-google-docs`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-google-docs/?=gatsby-source-google-docs) Source data from google docs and google drive

[`gatsby-transformer-remark`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark/?=gatsby-transformer-remark) Parses markdown files to html

[`html-react-parser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-react-parser) used on recommendation of `gatsby-source-google-docs`. Parses html and replaces it with react. We replace h2 tags with something that will generate our sidemenu, and we use it to replace normal images with Gatsby Images.

[`lodash.startcase`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#startCase) Single lodash method to convert kebab case path names to startcase for display in our sidebar.

[`react-scroll`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll) Scroll animation for the sidemenu in article views.

[`sanitize-html`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanitize-html) Sanitizes the html genrated by google docs to protect from XSS attacks and stray html written in google docs. We allow all attributes and added a couple of tags that shouldn't be sanitized.

[`gatsby-plugin-resolve-src`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-resolve-src/) Makes it easier to import components. We can just write `components/atoms` instead of `../components/atoms`.
